Thanks to a mate of mine, I was invited along to the opening of The Botanist in Birmingham, the latest in a new national chain of restaurants / bars serving cocktails, craft beer and food on a various array of [things](http://thebotanist.uk.com/image/gallery/10196-0398.jpg) [that food is not designed](http://thebotanist.uk.com/image/gallery/10196-0253.jpg) [to be served on](http://thebotanist.uk.com/image/gallery/10196-0264.jpg).

I've never done a bar review before (hell, I've only been blogging properly for a few weeks), so I thought it was a perfect opportunity to give it a go, particularly as I never usually get invited to this kind of thing (sniff).

The bar itself is located half way up Temple Street behind a set of beautifully ornate gates. The whole vibe is shabby chic, and clearly a lot of money has been spent on making it look attractively dishevelled. My mate, Jon, said the whole vibe reminded him of the Spirit of The 1890s sketch from Portlandia:

The drinks menu itself is very spirit-focussed, with a good variety of martinis, and lots of gin (more on that later). The bottled and canned craft beer selection is solid, with a good range of beers from the likes of Beavertown and Flying Dog, as well as Belgian and continental beers, as well as the usual macro lagers.

They didn't seem to have got the keg lines up and running when we were there (they open for real on Monday 6th April - Easter Monday), but the cask lines were very Midlands focussed, which was nice to see. Oakham's JHB and Bishops Farewell were on, as well as Complete Muppetry from local brewery Two Towers.

After some um-ing and ah-ing over the cocktail menu, I decided to plump for one of their 'Brewers and Botanists' cocktails / beer combinations. I've always been a bit sceptical about beer cocktails, but this was a good half way house, giving you a small cocktail (in my case Havana Club, Lime Juice and almond syrup served with 'micro red aramanthe') and a beer (mine came with Paulaner Hefeweisse).

The pairing turned out to work really well. The juicy lime, almond and warm booziness from the cocktail paired excellently with the banana and clove notes from the Hefe. There were only three of these pairings on the menu at the time, but I really like the concept and would love to see more.

For my second drink, I resisted the lure of the beer menu and went for a good old fashioned G+T. All the gins on the menu came with a garnish that was paired with the botanicals in the given gin. I went for the Blackwoods vintage gin, which came with lemon and lime zest, as well as coriander seeds.

When I was given my G+T, I was disappointed to see I'd been given Britvic tonic, which seemed akin to being served fish and chips in a posh restaurant. However, on looking at the menu, I realised that I could've traded up to a slightly better tonic, such as Fever Tree for 25p, or 1724 (which I'm told is really good) for 75p.

That tiny niggle aside, the whole experience was pretty enjoyable. It definitely felt like somewhere where I'd go with my wife before going out for a meal, rather than somewhere I'd go regularly for a drink with friends. That said, it's nice to know that there is a 'date bar' in town where I know I can get a decent pint, rather than dragging my other half to Brewdog or the Craven Arms.

Overall, this experience gave me confidence that, after a few years in the wilderness, Brum's bar scene is really kicking up a gear. Drinking in Birmingham used to be a pretty miserable experience, but we've now got a fair chunk of really excellent bars in the city centre. From The Wellington for real ale heads to places like The Botanist and Lost and Found, it means there's something for (pretty much) everyone.
