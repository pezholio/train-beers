Over the past 12 months, Beavertown has been going from strength to strength. They've been on my radar for some time, my first memory of them coming from a bottle of Gamma Ray brought over from Cotteridge Wines by a south Brum-dwelling mate.

Since then they've pretty much eschewed the bottle, and pretty much every Beavertown beer you see these days is canned. This new regime has reached its zenith with Power of The Voodoo, a collaboration with Boneyard Brewing and the world's first canned triple IPA.

I won't go too much in depth on the advantages of cans, because they've been covered in more detail by more knowledgeable folk than me. I will say that on the whole, canned beer is fresher and tastier than bottled, which is particularly important when you're dealing with highly-hopped IPAs - where the fresh hop flavour starts to die off pretty much as soon as the beer has finished fermenting.

The can itself is interesting, not least because of the design (influenced by a combination of heavy intake of cocktails and David Bowie's Goblin King in classic 80's film Labyrinth), but also the fact that it's a labelled can. While this is similar to what they do to some of their other non-core range beers (such as Quelle Saison), the way it differs is rather than the non-labelled part of the can being bare metal (and looking a bit ugly), the can itself is Beavertown branded. This is a nice way of ensuring they can get their limited run beers in cans, but without the added cost of printing a limited run of cans (which I guess is expensive).

It's also nice to see that this saving has been passed on to us, the beer drinker. For a 10% triple IPA, this is a bargain. While you'd spank about £15 on a bottle of Magic Rock Unhuman Cannonball (which, admittedly is bigger), this baby cost me about £4 - which is a lot of bang for your buck.

Anyway, onto the beer: It pours a golden amber colour and the nose is peach, lychee and passion fruit. At the first sip the malting seems to dominate, with a caramel sweetness and a hint of vanilla. It then drops to a clean bitterness and a hint of pine. There's a touch of sweet fruit on the finish and a warm alcohol burn, which you'd expect from a beer with such a high ABV.

I expected a bit more of a hop monster from this combination of breweries, but this is actually surprisingly balanced. It reminds me of Thornbridge's Jaipur X in a lot of ways and, like Jaipur X, is a beer that's well-made and perfectly nice, but overall, I expected something a bit more exciting.
