Gose is a funny one, it's been brewed for over 1000 years (mainly in Leipzig in Germany), but, during the 20th century almost died out. It's another one of those obscure hyperlocal European beer styles (such as KÃ¶lsch from Cologne and Saison from the French-speaking parts of Belgium) that have undergone a resurgence in recent years, thanks to mainly US craft brewers seeking newer flavours beyond the usual big hitting west coast IPAs.

Unusually for a German beer, it's not brewed to the Reinheitsgebot (the German purity law, which states that beer must contain only malt, hops, water and yeast), and also contains salt and coriander, as well as being fermented with lactobacillus as well as yeast - which gives the beer its trademark sourness.

The result is a fresh, salty, sour and dry beer, which is unlike any other beer style out there. I remember my first Gose at the Birmingham Beer Bash a few years back - Magic Rock's Salty Kiss Lime, probably the most aptly named beer there ever has been, a zingy, puckering blast of salt and sour fruit. I'd had sour beers before, but this was like nothing I'd ever tasted before.

Anyway, onto the beer. Westbrook Gose comes in a can, therefore combining two of the craft beer scene's recent obsessions, obscure European beer styles and putting beer in cans (trust me, it really makes a difference). I've been coveting it for some time, but I've only just managed to get my hands on a couple of cans from Bottledog in King's Cross on my way back to the station from work.

I'm drinking it straight from the can, so I can't tell you how it pours (I'm thinking of getting a plastic stem glass for such an occassion), but on cracking it open, the carbonation seems surprisingly low, and, sticking my nose in, the smell is almost overwhelmingly coriander, with a saline undertone that comes from (natch) the salt.

First sip and immediately you get a dry sour note, which then gives way to a gooseberry-like sourness, and then the salt hits the back of your mouth. You'd think that would be unpleasant, but the saltiness goes almost immediately, bringing a crisp dry finish that, along with the sour, lemony notes that hang around in the recesses of your mouth, immediately leave you wanting more.

As you carry on drinking, you get over the initial shock of the new, but what remains is the refreshing crispness that keeps you coming back for more.

I can see this becoming an addiction.
