One of my first posts on this here blog was about [the lack of craft breweries in the West Midlands](/2015/03/16/where-are-all-the-west-midlands-craft-breweries/). Since then, I've been digging in and researching, and it seems that, far from being a beer desert, there's a good crop of breweries popping up recently.

I've curated a list of local breweries as a [collaborative Google Doc here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DTwZMR3iNgQX_Ud6g6Gv4eW1K3W8uF4vOlWAq2ipa0/edit#gid=0), and am currently working on contacting them all to do a series of interviews. I want to do as much as I can to help them promote the great beers and beer culture we have in the Midlands; from real ale brewpubs, to cutting-edge craft breweries.

While poking around, I was chuffed to bits to discover that [some of these breweries are joining together to form the Mercian Brewers' Alliance](https://thebeerdidone.wordpress.com/2015/08/03/to-alliance-or-not-to-alliance-that-is-the-question/).

The alliance is currently made up of Blackheath's Fixed Wheel Brewery, Fownes Brewing Co. from Dudley, Stourbridge brewery and tap house Green Duck, Twisted Barrel Brewery from Coventry, central Birmingham-located Two Towers Brewery and Birmingham's Glassjaw. The group aims to promote their beers, as well as band together to increase their buying power and share best practices and new ideas.

This is, of course, not the first alliance of brewers to be announced recently, we've also seen Magic Rock, Brewdog and others found [United Craft Brewers](https://www.brewdog.com/lowdown/blog/united-craft-brewers--a-call-to-arms), and whilst the scale may be different, the aims are pretty much the same.

Whilst most craft breweries are businesses and technically in competition with each other, by banding together in this way they can help grow the market for craft beer and in turn, grow as businesses. It's also a bonus that more people are drinking better beer because, at the end of the day, most small breweries are in this game because they love the stuff.

With the Mercian Alliance however, it's about more than beer - it's regional pride that's at stake. We've seen the likes of London and Manchester being hailed as Meccas for great beer, and we know that we've got a beer culture (and history) every bit as good as theirs. It's about time we started shouting about it.

*The Mercian Brewers' Alliance launches on Friday 4th September at Green Duck Brewery with a collaboration beer, brewed by all the members of the Alliance. Find out more on the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/865072690246662/)*
