The UK craft beer scene is amazing. With fantastic breweries popping up
everywhere these days, it's difficult to remember the days when a
bottle of Sierra Nevada from the local Morrisons was considered exotic, and
breweries like The Kernel and Beavertown were little more than a twinkle in their
creator's eyes.

That said, there are some times where you look across the pond to the US with a
pang of jealousy. The odds on me tasting some of the legendary double IPAs like
Pliny the Elder or Heady Topper are slim to say the least.

However us Brits are finally getting to try at least one legendary US DIPA, in the
shape of Alpine Brewing Company's Pure Hoppiness. Until recently, it's been
tricky to get hold of outside Alpine's home town of San Diego, but thanks to
2014's acquisition of Alpine by Green Flash, their beers are finally stating to
get a wider audience.

I grabbed a bottle from [Tilt](http://tiltbrum.com/) on Wednesday, and immediately guzzled it down,
without a thought for tasting notes. Luckily, the
very next day, I clocked a bottle in the fridge at [Bottledog](https://www.brewdog.com/bars/uk/bottledog) while in London,
and resolved to give it a proper going over this time round.

Pouring the bottle and sticking my nose in, and it's a textbook US IPA nose with
pine, grapefruit and lemon. Taking the first sip, it's a dank, intenese bitterness
that stops just short of being so intense it feels like the enamel's being stripped
off your teeth. This bitterness is balanced by a touch of sweetness
from the obligatory (for a West Coast IPA) crystal malts. Finally, after the
carnival of IBUs, you're gently put to bed by a gentle kiss from a subtle boozy finish.

Unlike [last week's train beer](http://train-beers.pezhol.io/2016/02/19/train-beer-8-cloudwater-dipa-v2/) - Cloudwater's DIPA, this is slighly more hard
going. It's a sipper, rather than a chugger, and given the fact that this is
likely to be a limited release on these shores, that's so much the better.
