Cans are big news these days. Since I started down this beer blogging road, the vast majority of beers I've reviewed have been canned. It's easy to be snobby about cans - from Watney's Party Seven in the 70s to cans of Stella and Carling nowawdays, the humble tinned beer has been a signifier of 'low end' beers - pretty much the antithesis of craft.

However, when you stop and think about it, cans are the perfect receptacle for beer. They keep out 100% of light and air, they chill down extremely quickly, and they're easy to stack and carry.

The latest brewery to hop on board the canning train has been Huddersfield's Magic Rock, who've just started canning three of their core beers - Cannonball, High Wire Grapefruit, and Salty Kiss Gooseberry. I got my hands on all three from Cotteridge Wines last night, so decided to give a quick rundown of the whole lineup.

## Salty Kiss Grapefruit

The first gose I ever tried was Salty Kiss a few years ago at Birmingham Beer Bash, and it was a revelation. I hadn't had many sour beers before, and this was mouth-puckeringly sour, with a lovely saline finish. It started me on the road to seeking out more and more extreme sour hits, and I've got Magic Rock to thank for this.

This particular can pours a pale, almost pinkish hue, with a soft, weak head, and decent carbination. On the nose, you get what you'd expect from a gose, salt, lemon, and a touch of musky yeastiness. On the first sip, you get a lovely wheaty maltiness, followed by a hint of gooseberry, subtle sourness, and a gentle kiss of salt.

I don't know whether it's my taste that's changed, but this seems to be a slight departure from how I remember the original Salty Kiss. The beer I remember was an in-your-face salt and sour bomb, while this interpretation is an altogether more refined affair. I have no issue with this though, and I polished the rest of the can off without any hesitation.

## High Wire Grapefruit

There was a great letter in this month's What's Brewing, with the correspondent complaining about beers that tasted of 'fermented grapefruit', and I'd love to give him a can of this just to see his reaction. This just screams "GRAPEFRUIT" at you as soon as you stick your nose in, and makes you realise that all those hops you think have grapefruit notes really don't when you compare it to the real thing.

I fully expected not to like this beer at first. I really rate the original Magic Rock High Wire, and I was worried that the grapefruit would dominate, which it does on the first swig. However, once the initial hit of fruit fades, it reveals a solid malty body, followed by the gorgeous tropical fruit bitterness that you expect from High Wire. Finally that grapefruit comes back into play, drying out the finish beautifully.

## Cannonball

Finally, we come to the daddy of them all, Magic Rock's *pièce de résistance*, the peerless Cannonball, and I saved this for last. Suffice to say, it doesn't disappoint. The pour is vigourous and confident, pale amber, with a strong, creamy head. Sticking my nose in gives me peaches and a hint of vanilla, with a hint of booze and sticky sweetness.

Those peaches are still there on the first sip, along with mango and lychee, and a bittersweet finish and a warm booziness that puts hairs on your chest. Because it's canned as well, all these flavours are preserved wonderfully, tasting just as good as they would on leaving the brewery.

Overall, this is a great range from Magic Rock, really showcasing the full gamut of what the brewery do, from low ABV sours, to session ales and 7% hop bombs. I would happily buy any of these three again (let's face it, I definitely will), and am really looking forward to seeing what Magic Rock stick inside cans next.
