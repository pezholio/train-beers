Few European brewers dominate the craft beer world like Mikkel Borg Bjergs√∏. - Danish Gipsy brewer supreme and the brains behind Mikkeller.

While I'm not *always* a fan of Mikkeller's beers, one thing you can never accuse Mikkel of being is boring. And it was this that convinced me to go online and pre-order his new book.

Called 'Mikkeller's Book of Beer', it's co-written with his partner, journalist Pernille Pang. As well as the history of Mikkel's brewery, the book also covers a myriad other beer-related subjects, from the history of beer, to food pairing guidance.

The book starts with a history of Mikkel's early days with his (then) brewing partner Kristian Keller. He glossed over the love/hate relationship with his brother Jeppe (who runs Evil Twin Brewing) a bit, and only gave a brief mention of their fallings out and makings up. That said, he did big up Evil Twin a few times, so maybe their relationship has warmed somewhat.

After the history of Mikkeller, we move on to  the history of beer. This section is a tad light on detail, which may disappoint newbies, and the craft beer history section is much the same. Yet it was nice to see a mention of CAMRA and getting some background on the early days of the Danish craft brewing scene was good too.

I enjoyed his guide to beer styles, particularly Mikkel's notes on what he likes (and doesn't like) about certain styles. Each section also comes with recommendations of good examples of each style, with Mikkeller obviously heavily featured.

Reading the homebrewing section what struck me was how much was missing. The section on mashing particularly seemed light on detail. I think new homebrewers using it as a reference would struggle to make a successful brew, and there are far better books on homebrewing that go into far more detail.

The recipes were where the book really shined though. While I might not try brewing them myself, they are a great insight into how Mikkel brews, and provide a good jumping off point for inspiration.

The final section of the book gives some food recipes. To be honest, they feel a little tacked on, even though they have beer pairing suggestions. Also, coming from the likes of molecular gastronomy restaurant Noma, they didn't seem aimed at the novice cook. That said, the background to them added some colour, and I'm sure *someone* will give them a go.

That all said, Mikkeller's Book of Beer was a decent, light read, and is a well-packaged, beautifully designed book. There were also some nice insights and nuggets of detail that you'd struggle to find anywhere else. Hardcore beer geeks may be a bit disappointed, but even so, it's a worthy addition to any beer aficionado's collection.
