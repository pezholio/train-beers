*This is Spinal Tap* was released in 1984 and the exchange above is one of my favourite bits of the film. Lead singer Nigel Tufnel has just been told that the band record company won't release the Tap's latest album, Smell The Glove, because the cover, featuring a semi-clad woman being 'walked' on a dog lead and being forced to smell a leather clad glove, was considered beyond the pale.

This was in 1984, and, even back then (OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO) we were expected to laugh at Nigel and the band's archaic attitudes, but fast forward to 2015 and in the beer industry, we're still having this conversation about beer names and pump clips.

Beer writer Melissa Cole has been getting a serious amount of stick on Twitter for her [post on Roger Protz's blog](http://protzonbeer.co.uk/columns/2015/04/15/time-for-brewers-to-kill-sexist-images) about sexist beer branding - a piece that I thought didn't say anything overly controversial - mainly the industry needs to get a handle on sexist beer branding, and basically, grow up.

It's something I've touched on before in my blog, and has bugged me for a while, ever since Slater's made much capital over their [tiresome Top Totty ale being banned from the House of Commons Bar](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9057960/Top-Totty-beer-deemed-far-too-fruity-for-House-of-Commons-bar.html).

Whenever I see a brewery using sexist imagery, I make a mental note to avoid beer from that brewery. It's not a boycott as such, but branding like this sends a very clear message to me.

Firstly, the brewery clearly don't think much of me as a person that they think my head will be turned by a cartoon woman on a pumpclip. Secondly, if the brewer is going to spend so little time and thought on their branding that they retreat to the lowest common denominator, then they must spend exactly the same amount of thought and care on their beer \*.

I do get it, naming things is hard. I struggle to think of witty and memorable names for my homebrew beers (as a result, it's generally the name of the beer, and maybe some bland descriptor of the ingredients used), but guys (and they're almost always exclusively guys), when you next brew one of your 4.3% session ales, take a step back and think: "Am I really doing what's best for my company, and the beer industry in general?"

If, after thinking about that, you decide on a tiresome name like [Bristol's Ale](http://pumpclipparade.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/teignworthy-brewery-bristols-ale.html) and put a lady with big boobs on it, then I'm probably going to decide that your beer is as dated and cliched as Spinal Tap's mock rock stylings. One of Spinal Tap's reviews in *This is Spinal Tap*  spells it out best:

> This tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within. The musical growth of this band cannot even be charted. They are treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.

Anyway, here's some music:

\* I do, however, make an exception for Oakham Ales becuase they generally make excellent beers, athough I found their [pump clip for The Opportunist](http://pumpclipparade.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/oakham-ales-opportunist.html) massively disappointing.
