Ah, Guinness. Probably one of the most famous non-lager beer brands in the world, if not the most famous beer brand full stop. Beer of last resort for the real ale drinker, famously served extra cold in the late 90s, and probably the first alcoholic drink I drank in a licensed premises (a half, with blackcurrant, surreptitiously given to me by a mate's dad on a day out).

The style that made Guinness famous, dry, or Irish stout, is probably the most well-known of stout sub styles and it's not really a style that craft breweries tend to make. Most stouts are usually heavily malt forward, often with coffee, vanilla or cherry added, and generally at least over 5% (often reaching over 9% for Russian Imperial Stouts).

Guinness have been trying to get in on the craft beer action of late, 'wowing' us with a porter, an export stout and a (snooze) golden ale. It's therefore interesting to see The Kernel, one of the UK's finest craft breweries, turn this on its head with their take on a dry stout.

It's quite a low ABV, even for a dry stout, coming in at 4.4% (which would tend to put it in the same league as a porter), but the nose is heavily chocolatey, and it sees like it would pour inky black (being on a train, as usual, I haven't got a glass to pour it into).

Diving into the beer, the first thing you notice is the light chocolate playing beautifully with the berry notes from the mosaic hops. Once that inital flavour dies, you then get a gentle touch of smoke, marrying well with bitter grapefruit and a super dry finish.

This is not an overly complex beer, nor should it be. Dry stout is an everyman style, and, for better or worse, has stood the test of time. I could session away on this quite happily for a good few pints (if my thirst for CONSTANT NOVELTY could be sated). The Mosaic hops make for an interesting alternative to the blackcurranty Brambling Cross hops which usually work so well in a traditional stout, and add a nice modern twist to an otherwise safe, traditional style.
