Not many off-licences have their own sommelier - but [Cotteridge Wines](https://twitter.com/cotteridgewines) isn't your usual offy. It may look like an unassuming neighbourhood outdoor\* on the outside, but once inside, it's an Aladdin's cave for anyone who's into their craft beer.

I headed down to their relatively new tasting room on Saturday afternoon to meet my good buddy (and fellow beer geek) [Ben](https://twitter.com/rondema) to taste five of some of the world's best beers. I'd been to one of these tastings before and it didn't end well, but this time I came prepared, bolstered by a three course lunch, and a tactical steak bake from Greggs on the way.

I arrived about half an hour early, and found that Roberto (the aforementioned sommelier), who usually guides and drinks along at the tasting sessions, is on some serious antibiotics so we'll have to drink his share. I reluctantly rise to the challenge but, while I wait, I have a couple of thirds from the well-stocked growler filling station to pass the time. I go for Kernel's Nelson Sauvin and Simcoe IPA and, conscious of the high ABVs that I'm about to imbibe, Weird Beard's low ABV hop monster, Little Things That Kill.

Six o'clock rolls around, and we take our seats for the tasting proper. The first beer is [Jolly Pumpkin's Bam Noire](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/jolly-pumpkin-bam-noire/77543/). We're starting small tonight and this is the lowest Ratebeer rated beer we're having, only(!) receiving a lowly 91 overall on Ratebeer.

Bam Noire is a Brett-infected dark saison, and it pours inky black, with a tight, creamy head. Drinking it, the yeast character really dominates, the Brett funk coming through immediately, followed by heavy bubblegum notes and a super-dry finish. Unusually for a dark saison, there was very little detectable malting, which I imagine is due to the Brett eating through all the complex sugars. This was probably my least favourite of the night, but still an excellent beer, and one I'd definitely have again.

We move on to the next beer, which is [Alesmith's Horny Devil](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/alesmith-horny-devil/2487/), Alesmith's tribute to that Belgian classic, Duvel. It pours a lovely golden colour, and the nose is all citrus, coriander and peppercorn. Drinking it, it definitely reminds me of Duvel, but with all the flavours turned up to eleven. It's a dizzying array of sugar-sweet, orange peel, spices, bubblegum and clove, with a lovely alcohol burn on the finish. One to savour, and we all make the most of our share.

Next up, is [Majsgoop](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/mikkeller--three-floyds-majsgoop/260476/), a collaboration between Mikkeller and Three Floyds, and one of their "goop" range, all "Barley" Wines that make one grain centre stage. This particular goop, as the name suggests (if you speak Danish) puts corn to the fray.

I'm not the biggest fan of barley wines as a style, but the amount of hops in this one makes for an exceptionally well-balanced beer. The corn doesn't impart too much flavour, but combined with the hops, makes for an almost marmaladey flavour. Deceptively easy drinking given the ABV, I polish this off really quickly.

After what in politer circles would be termed a 'comfort break', we crack on with [Brooklyn's Black Ops](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/brooklyn-black-ops/82103/). I do not have too high an opinion of Brooklyn, their ubiquitous lager was one of my gateways to craft beer, but now I find it difficult to drink with a strange and almost marmite-like character which I find pretty unpleasant.

That said, after one sip of this barrel-aged imperial stout, which is bottle conditioned with champagne yeast, my opinion of Brooklyn changed forever. It had beautiful oak, vanilla, chocolate and caramel flavours. The booziness also made me think that the Woodford Reserve barrels might have had a fair bit of bourbon left in them. Add that to the subtle, silky fizziness lent by the secondary champagne yeast fermentation and this was the beer of the night for me.

The penultimate beer of the night is a beer that I thought I'd missed out on, this year's release of [Magic Rock's Unhuman Cannonball](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/magic-rock-un-human-cannonball/213427/). This is released as a limited edition every year, using Magic Rock's freshest delivery of US hops.

The pour is far cloudier than last year's release, which is good to see as I find it gives the beer more character. For a triple IPA, it's not surprising that it delivers big time on hop flavour, all tropical fruit and piney punch. Ordinarily I'd be hailing this as the beer of the night, but this isn't an ordinary tasting and compared to the other beers it seemed a little one-dimensional.

The final beer was the icing on the cake, Mikkeller's legendary [Nelson Sauvignon](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/mikkeller-nelson-sauvignon/115037/). This is a yearly release, and rarer than hen's teeth. In fact, (as far as my hazy memory can recollect) Cotteridge Wines had the lion's share of the retail stock in the UK this year.

Nelson Sauvignon is fermented with champagne yeast, brett and enzymes, and aged in chardonnay barrels. It pours a beautiful hazy amber, and has a gorgeous, vinious fruitiness, which is in no way overpowered by the brett character from the yeast. I'm certainly going to be keeping my eye out for the next release.

With the tasting over, we stayed behind for a few extra refreshments, namely Lervig's Brewers Reserve Barley Wine, as well as two from Mikkeller - George! and Monk's Brew barrel aged raspberry quad. As for how they tasted, I couldn't quite tell you, but rest assured they were excellent.

The tasting wasn't cheap, at Â£40 a head, but it was a perfect chance for me to get my lips around some really rare (and expensive) beers, with some great beer chat and company. And I'd say that was worth its weight in gold.

\* That's West Midlands talk for 'off-licence'
