Ah, Brewdog. Where would we be without Brewdog? I, for one, would probably be drinking much poorer beer than I do now. Brewdog, for all their manufactured controversy and 'punk not punk' attitude, have done a tremendous amount for craft beer in this country, and, like I'm sure is the case for many people, were a gateway drug into the world of craft beer *.

This latest beer of theirs has caused a bit of a stir with its name, which, on the surface seems deliberately provocative, but, on reading the label, there's a pretty decent bit of beer history in the form of an extract from 'A Treastise on Food and Diet' by Dr Jonathan Pereira.

The extract describes an India Pale Ale as 'carefully fermented, so as to be devoid of all sweetness' and 'containing double the amount of hops', going on to say that 'it forms, therefore, a most valuable restorative beverage for invalids and convalescents'.

A nice story then, and a good excuse for Brewdog to ape the likes of The Kernel Brewery and brew a dry, strong IPA with minimal sweetness, putting the hops front and centre as the star of the show (Crema brewery wrote a [nice piece the other week about 'dry' and 'sweet' IPAs](http://cremasbeerodyssey.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/changing-tastes-of-ipa.html), which is well worth a read for more detail on this point).

Cheating a bit, I didn't drink this on the train (because it's 8.7% and I had to drive the other end), but I cracked it open when I got home (and I got to use a glass - yay!).

It pours a light amber colour, and the nose is distinctly grassy with a hint of grapefruit and the slightest hint of a sweetness on the nose.

First sip, and there's an instant huge hit of tropical fruit, followed by resinous pine and a clean bitterness.

The finish comes with a delicate kiss of sweetness, which lures you into a false sense of security, because this is immediately followed by a warm booziness that reminds you that despite the low level of sweetness, this is a big double IPA.

As I mentioned before, this seems like Brewdog are going firmly for Kernel territory here, but because it's force carbonated and (I assume) filtered, it's super clear and clean tasting, an interesting change from the bottle conditioned and unfiltered world of Kernel.

All in all, it's a beautifully made beer, and while it's not the best DIPA I've had, it's certainly a unique beer, and one I'd have no hesitation drinking again.
