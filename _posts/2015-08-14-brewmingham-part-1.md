I'm a proud West Midlander. I was born in Wolverhampton, raised in Staffordshire and currently residing just on the border of north Birmingham. Working in London for much of the week, has made me even more fanatical about where I'm from, and I take any opportunity to go on and on about how great the Midlands is.

One thing I haven't really had much chance to wax lyrical about in recent years is our brewing culture. For a region which is so close to that home of British brewing, Burton-upon-Trent, we haven't had any breweries that have really stood out.

However, that seems all set to change. The few years have seen an explosion, both in new breweries, as well as established breweries experimenting with that thorny classification we call craft.

With this in mind, I've done my research, and over the next few weeks, I'll be putting up a series of interviews with the people who help make the West Midlands brewing scene tick, from brewpubs to macro-scale behemoths.

The first crop of breweries are two breweries located within pubs - one established brewery, and one so new, the paint is barely dry. So, without further ado, onto the interviews!

## Black Tap Brewing Co. - Redditch

<img src="/img/black-tap-1.jpg" alt="The Black Tap team" class="img-responsive center-block">

Black Tap was founded in 2011 in Stafford by two accountants(!), Chris and Nicky Roberts who both had a passion for homebrewing. After moving from their garage to an industrial unit, they finally set up a brewpub in Redditch this month. I spoke to Chris Roberts from Black Tap to find out more about their background.

### What got you into brewing in the first place?

I first got into brewing at home to be honest. I happened to be wandering around Wilkinson and noticed a cheap beer kit and thought I would give it a go as it was around Christmas time. The beer turned out awful but I caught the brewing bug and kept it up.

Eventually my wife got fed up with me taking over the kitchen and, lacking a garage or shed, decided to rent a very small industrial unit in Stafford (an hour up the road). The reason for this was that my old university (Staffordshire University) were providing start up funding for small businesses under something called the Speed Plus Programme.

The programme provided me with a few grand in cash but also valuable business support. I am an accountant by trade, so I was OK with finance and accounting knowledge, but was inexperienced in other aspects of business. So this support was very useful. I decided to try and turn my hobby into a small business. My wife eventually came round to the idea and joined me in the venture. We had to do a Dragons Den-style pitch for the funding support, which we won.

That is how we initially got started. With the money I built a stainless steel HERMS brewing system which could only produce about one firkin and a pin of beer (60 litres) each brew session. Absolute nightmare!

### What's your setup like?

Our first set up was the 15 gallon HERMS mentioned above. Speed Plus, who funded our start up, saw we were doing well (we were putting out beer in bottle at various awesome specialist beer shops in the West Midlands and Staffordshire) so they invested a further amount of cash (a substantial amount) which enabled us to buy a 1bbl pilot brewery system, stainless steel conical fermenters, a load of Black Tap casks and pins, rent on the unit, a tonne of grain, etc. This set up is still small but keeps the brewing process personal. We can now produce about five casks on a single and nine casks on a double brew session. This same kit is now used in our brewpub in Redditch High Street, where we will be brewing in full view of our customers.

### What sparked the move from Stafford to Redditch?

The move from our unit in Stafford was due to a few factors really. We were not enjoying the long drive up the M6, the warehouse is cold and draughty and not much fun (especially in the winter!). So we started to explore other possibilities.

I met a guy called Grant through a mutual friend. Grant is a businessman and had recently purchased Beech House in Redditch, where his other businesses were now operating from on the second floor. We approached him about leasing the ground floor as a brewpub and he agreed. He has since joined Black Tap as a major shareholder and is actively involved in the business. So there are now three owners, my wife, myself, and Grant.

### What breweries would you say you were influenced by?

My main brewery influences would include Black Rocks in Michigan, Dogfish Head and Kernel. However there have been some other influences such as a place in Leeds called Friends of Ham, an amazing craft beer venue.

I was working in Lincoln in a few years ago, just about the time when I was thinking about pitching to Speed Plus, when I told a taxi driver called Steve about my ideas. I ended up using this guy as my taxi driver all week between my hotel and the client. Over that week he really encouraged me to give it a go and I owe a lot of this to him really. I hope he gets to read this and knows it is him I am talking about.

There are a few books that inspired me too and I would recommend these to anyone starting up in business. [The E Myth Revisited](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses/dp/0887307280) is key.

### Was becoming a brewpub always on your list of plans when starting up, or was this something that organically came about?

The brewpub was on the three year business plan we put together for the Speed Plus Programme. And we are right on track with it time-wise.

### Have you got any future plans beyond opening the pub? Would you like to see a chain of brewpubs?

We do have plans for expansion. We are quite an ambitious team of directors in that regard. Our main focus at the moment is getting our first venue in Redditch perfected and running exactly how we want it. We have recruited a fantastic team, which were very carefully selected to match our seven core values. This team is already doing an amazing job.

## Rock 'n' Roll Brewhouse, Digbeth, Birmingham

<img src="/img/rock-n-roll-1.jpg" alt="Brew Springsteen" class="img-responsive center-block">

I'm going to put my cards on the table here. Up until a few weeks ago, I'd never heard of Rock 'n' Roll Brewhouse, but they've been quietly doing their thing from the rooftop of the Lamp Tavern in Digbeth for a few years now. Lynn and Mark from the brewery were kind enough to give me the skinny on their operations...

### How long have you been brewing? And what got you started in the first place?

We've both been brewing for various lengths of time but the Rock and Roll Brewhouse itself was formed 6 years ago when Mark the brewer decided to start his own brewery rather than keep working for others. Lynn the brewster joined 2 years ago.

### Do you stick to a core range of beers? Or do you tend to experiment with a range?

Both. We have a 'core' range of beers such as Brew Springsteen, Lamplight, Mash City Rocker and Harley Barley but we also do a lot of experimental brews, one off specials and seasonal brews. Sometimes these become part of the core range if they prove popular with our customers.

We're at the stage at the moment where we can do quite a lot of experimenting without worrying too much. At the Blue Bell, for example, we do a lot of experimenting with fruit beers and these have proved very popular with requests for repeat brews; for example 'Pinkshinyultrablast' our strawberry beer is looking like becoming a regular brew.

We also do a lot of seasonal one-off beers such as a green hop beer in September with hops from the brewer's garden; in June elderflowers picked from the farm across from the brewery in the morning and in the boil by the afternoon; Quince from the brewster's garden in the Autumn, and Blackberries from the brewster's garden and from hedgerows near the brewery. The brewster likes to follow the 'foraging year' when brewing!

### Other than the pub, can we get your beers anywhere else?

We have a brewery at the Lamp Tavern and one at the Blue Bell Cider house and so our priority is to keep both pubs supplied with our beers - we regularly have 2 beers on at both pubs at any one time.  But we also send beers out to Beer Festivals as well as, occasionally, to other pubs for example The Anchor in Birmingham and the Weighbridge at Alvechurch. We regularly update our Twitter and Facebook pages with what beers are on at each pub as well as where else we've sent them to.

### Would you say you were a pub first and foremost, or a brewery?

We're definitely a brewery. The 2 pubs we're based at are owned/run by others. As an aside about the two pubs: Re The Lamp - We're the only pub rooftop brewery in Birmingham, and we think Britain? - we've not been able to find another brewery based on a roof. Re the Blue Bell - We're occupying the original brewhouse building, and the last brewer was actually a brewster, so we're carrying on the tradition of a female brewer at the Blue Bell (who is also Birmingham's only brewster)

### All your beers have rock and roll themes - which comes first? The beer or the name?

Hahahahaha! The beer obviously, but we do have a list of future potential names that regular customers like to suggest!

### You've had some beers at the Birmingham Vegan Beer Festival recently - how important is staying vegan for you?

Very important because we have a purer, unadulterated product. We intend to always be a vegetarian/vegan friendly brewery. At the moment we are 100% veggie friendly and 99% vegan - only Dr Feelgood our chocolate milk stout (Lactose) and Bee Hop Deluxe (honey) are not vegan.

We also try and minimise our carbon footprint as much as possible - as well as all the foraging the brewster does - all spent grain from both breweries goes to Martin's farm opposite the Blue Bell to feed the cows - who absolutely love it! The spent hops go on the compost heap behind the Blue Bell.
