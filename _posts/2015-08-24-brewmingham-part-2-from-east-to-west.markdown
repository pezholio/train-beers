**We're into part two of my (almost) exhaustive interview series with small and upcoming West Midlands breweries. If you haven't read part one, it's [here](train-beers.pezhol.io/2015/08/14/brewmingham-part-1/) (go on, I'll wait).**

I've called this series 'Brewmingham' basically because it was a semi-good pun, but Birmingham itself is pretty thin on the ground for breweries given its size and brewing history ([there's a Wikipedia article which pretty much sums up the state of play here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_breweries_in_Birmingham)). However, if you venture beyond the boundaries of Brum, the craft brewing scene is pretty lively.

My next two interviews come courtesy of two breweries on the outer edges of the West Midlands, Twisted Barrel in Coventry, and Sacre Brew in Wolverhampton.

## Twisted Barrel - Coventry

As someone who dwells in north Brum, Coventry is pretty much marked in my head with "HERE BE DRAGONS". I remember getting lost on the ring road a fair few times, and their Ikea is quite good, but other than that, it's pretty much unexplored territory.

That said, since finding out about Twisted Barrel, I've seen Coventry in a new light. Set up in 2014 as 'The world's first pico brewery', they've since relaunched with much larger kit, as well as a tap house that hosts (amongst other things) quiz and film nights. I caught up with Ritchie Bosworth from the brewery to find out more.

### What got you into beer in general, and brewing in particular?

My love of ale started whilst living in New Zealand, as they don't really do any generic lager there. When I returned to the UK most of my friends had got into real ale and things snowballed from there. Real ale went onto craft, then we started producing our own podcast called All Hail The Ale in which we rated beers and waxed lyrical about beer. Then we felt we should probably know a bit more about brewing if we were going to criticise other peoples beer.

Both Chris and I, who started the company together with our partners, received home brew kits for Christmas. We did one kit brew each and then immediately moved onto doing our own recipes. A few successful wedding beers later for friends, and we started the process of registering commercially.

We started at a very small size of 60 litres as we both had successful careers and didn't want to risk everything from the get go, albeit not careers that necessarily excited us. We realised fairly quickly that we loved it and so expanded from there.

### Where does the name Twisted Barrel come from?

Specifically a late night Facebook conversation. More generally, it's an amalgamation of the modern and the traditional. Our 'modernism' is usually putting a 'twist' on a regular beer style, be it vanilla pods in our mild or elderflower in our saison. However, we're very much committed to traditional brewing methods, hence 'barrel' which we see as a traditional symbol of brewing.

### You say you're more folk than punk - does that mean you feel like you're more like a traditional English brewery than an American style craft brewery?

We feel that 'punk' has been co-opted and diluted to the point where it no longer means what it once did. We prefer to think of ourselves as 'folk' as we're very people oriented, we like to meet people face to face and talk about our beers, we believe in ethical business practices such as paying the Living Wage and not using any animal products. These are very 'folksy' attributes as opposed to punk. We also wanted to tie our branding into the original artwork in our Tap House which was designed by a local artist called Stewart Easton whose work is very folksy looking. Hence our alignment with 'folk'.

We do not feel either traditional English or modern American craft. To be honest, we're kinda sick of the real ale v craft debate and don't align ourselves with either. We believe in good beer that is full of flavour, end of. If that comes in a keg, a cask, a bottle or an old boot, we don't really care.

### It's great to see a tap house put on so many events - do you think it's important to be a destination that's about more than just the beer?

We do. Beer is awesome, but it's not the be all and end all in life. Beer is a fantastic social lubricant that brings people together, but we shouldn't place it on a pedestal. The events provide folks with a reason to return again and again, rather than just for beer. They're also a chance for us to work and collaborate with other people, as well as indulge our own passions such as music, movies, sci-fi and all round general geekiness.

### What breweries are you influenced by?

Consciously, none. Subconsciously, probably everything I drink really. We've never really set out to design a particular recipe that riffs off another breweries beer, or apes/clones another beer. We tend to have in mind something that we want to drink, and then work from there. We've probably got that particular taste/style in mind from trying someone else's beer, but as I said it's not really a conscious effort, more a general accumulation of 'drinking research' :-)

When it came to our branding, we did look at what other breweries were doing and particularly liked a few breweries styles, so I guess that was a slight influence in the way we approached our brand (rather than the actual physical appearance of it).

### You’re a founder member of the Mercian Alliance of Brewers - why do you think it’s important for midlands brewers to stick together?

We like to work with other people, whatever their line of work. We feel that you always learn something new from collaborative work, it's also a fantastic business opportunity to introduce yourselves to customers from other businesses. We work with a local chutney producer, Not Just Jams, to make chutneys and jams that contain our products. We work with other businesses on site at Fargo Village to arrange events. We work with local arts organisations to assist with events and make bespoke products.

Our desire to collaborate and work with other businesses is the key reason why we helped establish the Mercian Alliance of Brewers. We enjoy working with other brewers to create unique one off products, and sharing production methods and knowledge  We're now also reaping some of the business benefits by being able to share the costs of materials etc. This is not really borne out of any regional affiliation to the Midlands personally. Whilst the Midlands is dominated by well established, respected, traditional breweries, the market for smaller breweries is quite tough, so perhaps there is a 'lets stick together' mentality, but it's not really a conscious effort to do so.

We've found a lot of brewers really want to work collaboratively, whereas some don't and are happy to continue to work with their existing customer base. We respect both methodologies, but personally find that working together improves the quality of beer in general and makes life more interesting for the consumer too.

### What are your future plans?

There are three key strands to our business strategy; 1) growth and stability 2) working collaboratively and 3) increasing the brewing capital in the local area.

We want to become established as a viable business model, and repay our investors within the next three years. We want to build a following locally and become a key part of the Coventry beer scene. We're very keen to work with local home brewers and encourage them to set up commercially and increase the brewing capital in Coventry. We also want to explore export opportunities within the next 6 months to get our beers further afield.

We'd like to be in a position to expand within 3-5 years to a 20BBL set up and become a regional producer. In the long term, 5-10 years, we are keen to collaborate with local educational institutions to establish brewing courses within the Midlands and utilise our current location as a working model for students to learn in, as well as a front end for showcasing local beer.

## Sacre Brew - Wolverhampton

<img src="/img/sacre-brew-2.jpg" alt="Gwen Sanchirico from Sacre Brew" class="img-responsive center-block">

I'll always have an affinity with Wolverhampton - my home for the first four years of my life, and the home of my default football team (when forced to express a preference). Beer wise, Wolverhampton is dominated by Marston's (formerly Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries) - brewers of Banks's Bitter and Pedigree, and the owner of a number of breweries across the country, from Ringwood in the New Forest to Jennings in the Lake District.

As a result, Wolverhampton has always been a bit of a monoculture when it comes to beer, where even the local gig venue - Wolverhampton Civic Hall - is dominated by Marston's beers. However, one woman has been doing her best to fly the flag for craft beer in Wolverhampton, and that's Gwen Sanchirico, owner of Sacre Brew.

### You're from the US - when did you come over to the UK, and what did you think about the beer scene when you got over here?

Since I was 16, I've made trips to the UK about once a year till 1994. I remember drinking Courage, Watney's, Bass, Tetley's, Felinfoel, and they were all pretty forgettable. I stayed away till 2010 and I moved here in 2012. For the first year I kept trying different brews and came to the same conclusion: I'm not a fan of traditional British beer, which is one of the reasons why I decided to open up my own brewery.

Real ale makes me sick. Literally - I can drink just half a pint and feel like death the next day, all day. That's not my idea of a good time, so I won't touch anything in a cask. Other beers do not have this effect on me, unless they're mass-produced crap beer, which I don't drink. I have a hypothesis about why this is so but I won't get into it!

The move to artisanal beer began in the US thirty years ago, and it's only just starting to happen in the UK. Both countries had the same problems for decades of a corporate, industrial, poor-excuse-for-a-beer landscape lacking diversity and imagination. Prohibition created this scenario in the US; war created it in the UK.

When homebrewing was legalized in the US in 1978, it wasn't long before passionate homebrewers realized that their beer was a million times better than the fraudulent offerings from the major breweries. They started opening up their own commercial microbreweries, with the standards they developed as homebrewers, and the movement towards creative, flavorsome, high-quality beer was born.

Fast-forward to today and Britain is just starting to recognize the diversity of beer styles and entertaining alternative brewing processes. I finally discovered the new wave of microbreweries when I stopped hanging out in Wolverhampton and started spending my nights out in Birmingham. I identified a small range of domestic beers that taste different from each other, express a wide range of flavors, have no off flavors, and didn't make me want to kill myself in the morning.

For me, this is like getting into a time machine and traveling back to the early '80s. I have thirty years' worth of knowledge (not including my own brewing experience) with me at the inception of a movement. The British are more conservative and slower to accept a new idea but the lag time is over. I couldn't open up a microbrewery on a shoestring budget back home; there's just too much competition and I don't have the capital to slip in seamlessly. But in the UK, I'm in on the ground floor because it's still so new and I have huge experiential advantages. There's very little competition and a huge demand. This is a very exciting time to be a creative, independent brewer.

### How long have you been brewing seriously?

I'm very serious about everything I do. From my first batch of homebrew in 1993 I fully immersed myself in the craft and always strove to improve my skills and understand the science of brewing. I threw away the free beer kit that came with my brewing equipment and went straight to putting together a recipe for a spruce beer.

I'm one of those intense people who dives in headfirst into whatever I do. So when I opened a commercial microbrewery in 2014, it wasn't all that different to my approach to homebrewing. I am not OK with mistakes but I make a point to learn from them so that they're not repeated. I'm always looking for improvements in efficiency and process.

### You've done a collaboration beer with the Brewdog bar in Birmingham, but are there any breweries you'd like to collaborate with?

Of course! At the very top of my list would be to do a brew on my small kit with Sam Calagione of Dogfish Head. But I suspect that will never happen. As for breweries in the UK, I'd have to say Beavertown, Mad Hatter, Bexar County, and Liverpool Craft.

Beavertown makes consistently great beers. You can taste the thought and quality that goes into them. If someone told me they were an American brewery, I'd believe it. They don't do anything stupid or gimmicky - they're truly all about the beer.

Gaz Matthews, the owner of Mad Hatter, is a genius and his perceptual abilities are nothing short of astonishing. I had a two-hour conversation with him just about yeast once. Marc Barbarossa, the head brewer there, is also highly analytical and puts a lot of thought into his brewing strategies. These are qualities I look for in brewers. Mad Hatter is known for their experimental and constantly changing beers, so anything goes over there.

Steve Saldana from Bexar County Brewing is a fellow American who also enjoys pushing the boundaries of beer and I have a lot of respect for his personal quest to shock the British public into expanding their beer horizons. Steve's on another dimensional plane in terms of creativity, and knows what outlandish combinations will actually work together harmoniously with delicious results.

I got to know the folks from Liverpool Craft at the Birmingham Beer Bash and they're all sweethearts. Joe Murphy, in particular, I think would be a lot of fun to brew with because of his intellectual sense of play and he's the one pushing the boundaries at that brewery - with judiciousness.

### Do you have a core range? Or do you prefer to experiment?

I love to experiment. If I couldn't experiment, I wouldn't bother doing what I'm doing. As long as I can try new things, I don't mind the long-term challenge of maintaining consistency while constantly improving a core brew. And I don't have new ideas all the time, so I need solid fallbacks.

My core brews are Wendigo, an American IPA brewed with Mosaic hops; Creme de Stout, a mint-chocolate stout that's light enough to drink all night, brewed with peppermint and spearmint but no chocolate; Man on the Oss, a rye saison; and Griselda, an Argentine golden ale which is a lot like a lager fermented with an ale yeast.

I have many brews that I brew only once a year, such as a smoked porter, Buffalo Beer (a spiced Belgian quad), an oak-smoked wheat ale with rowans, and a couple of gruits. Then there are some regular brews that I make differently each time, such as my American pale ales (I change the hops around) and a Belgian-style tripel called Hailstone (I vary the spices used). During the winter months, I take advantage of the free coldness and I also brew lagers.

When I first started Sacre Brew I was under a lot of pressure to establish my core brews and stick to them. What I've found is that's the methodology of an old model followed by every traditional British brewery, so it's not for me. I've found people love variety and new flavor experiences, which suits my experimental desires just fine. Collaborations with other brewers - or even non brewers - is also highly satisfying and puts my head outside of its usual limits.

One of the advantages of being a microbrewer is that I can respond to the demand. If I make a one-off beer that turns out to be wildly popular and people ask me to brew more, I will. And if a core beer falls out of favor, I have no problem taking it out of rotation and brewing something else instead. Everybody's happy.

### What are your future plans?

I just applied for an off-license sales license. If that goes through, people can come directly to Sacre Brew to buy my beer by mid September. I'm also planning to open up a tap room inside the brewery just Friday/Saturday nights as soon as I can get everything together. Hopefully that'll be in October. It'll be tiny and won't seat more than 20 people but I've been in far smaller bars!

So with direct bottle sales and a small brewery bar, I think I'll be able to upgrade to a bigger kit and then start saving up for my ultimate goal: a brewpub. I don't exactly know where yet, but ideally in the Wolverhampton city centre, and the brewery will be inside the bar (or the other way around). It'll be an American-style brewpub with some Belgian beer cafe aspects, too.

I am told by locals that there was a time when people would come from all over - including Birmingham - for a night out in Wolverhampton. I'd like to help bring that trend back by attracting people who love good beer in a stimulating but chilled environment.

I also have this nagging idea to open up a hot tub (actually converted mash tuns) beer garden but I haven't figured out how to work that in yet.

Whatever my plans, they do not involve world domination. I intend to keep it real, maintain the highest quality possible, even if that means not expanding beyond the West Midlands. I'd rather stay small and maintain my high standards than compromise so I can sell my beer all over the country in stores I'd never shop in myself because they're so unethical. I'd much rather be known for making great beer than making more money than I need.

### Where can we buy your beers?

In Wolverhampton, the Wine Seller in Compton stocks all my beers. The Arena Theatre also stocks my beer in their bar, which is open when they have performances. In Birmingham, there's Stirchley Wines, Cotteridge Wines, Connolly's Wine Merchants, and Wine Lord; In Spirit and Red & White in Tamworth; Vino in Kinver are all bottle shops. Pubs that carry Sacre Brew are Cherry Reds, The Anchor in Digbeth, and Sadler's Brewhouse in Lye.

The only exception I make for keeping it local is Saucy Pears in Worcester. There's a list on my website and people can sign up for emails letting them know when a new beer batch is out and where they can find it.
