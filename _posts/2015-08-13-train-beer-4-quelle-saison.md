I love a good saison, me. If you look at [my Untappd history](https://untappd.com/user/pezholio), it's probably my third most drunk style (after American IPAs and Pale Ales) - something about the barnyardy funk and bone dry finish keeps my tastebuds coming back for more.

It's a diverse style too, from the absolute classic of the style, [Saison Dupont](http://www.brasserie-dupont.com/dupont/en/6967-saison-dupont.html) (which I could happily drink all day) to the Brett-tastic, complexly flavoured [Fant√¥me](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/fantome-saison/7661/) (which is criminally hard to find). Saisons cover a wide gamet - from subtle bitterness to in-your-face hop bombs, and pale straw to inky black (see Brewdog's [Black Jacques saison from last year](https://www.brewdog.com/lowdown/blog/meet-black-jacques-and-ab16)).

Beavertown's latest addition to their core range has been around before. I first came across Quelle, a dry hopped saison, last year, when it first showed up. I wasn't keen on it at first, finding the harsh bitterness not marrying well with the dry saison finish.

However, whether it's the beer that's changed, or my tastebuds, I'm happy to say that this batch is much improved. There's a beautiful citrus note on the nose, and the first sip is a riot of grapefruit, giving way to a grassy flavour, marrying beautifully with the trademark saison barnyard funk, and a bone dry, bitter finish which isn't unduly harsh.

The body is rather lacking, but I find the other flavours more than make up for this, and the slight wateriness makes for a beautifully refreshing beer, which is most welcome after a hot sticky ride back to Euston.

I was [a bit mean to Beavertown on my last review](http://train-beers.pezhol.io/2015/06/04/train-beer-3-power-of-the-voodoo/) (and probably unduly harsh), but I'm happy to make amends with this review. Quelle is a welcome addition to the Beavertown CANon (geddit?).
