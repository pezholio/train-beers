If you like beer, and live in the West Midlands, it's a pretty good place to be. Birmingham alone has got [the best bottle shop in the country](http://www.ratebeer.com/p/cotteridge-wines/26734/), an [awesome craft beer festival](http://birminghambeerbash.co.uk/), and a [decent wodge of bars](http://paradisecircus.com/2015/03/06/the-craft-city-line/) in the city centre serving a fantastic range of beers, from the obligatory [Brewdog bar](https://www.brewdog.com/bars/uk/birmingham), to the [Craven Arms](http://www.blackcountryales.co.uk/the-pubs/the-craven-arms/), which combines the cozy feel of a traditional boozer with a fine selection of cask and keg craft beers.

But, what we lack in the West Midlands are craft breweries. We've got a proud brewing history (we're home to the IPA for God's sake), but there's only a handful of breweries that I'd describe as 'craft'.

The first brewery that springs to mind is Sacre Brew in Wolverhampton. Owner / head brewer Gwen Sanchirico has come out with a solid range of interesting brews, including Man on the Oss, a rye saison, and her collaboration with Brewdog Birmingham's bar staff, Cocœclipse - an incredible toasted coconut porter.

It could be argued that Purity in Warwickshire were doing craft before it was A Thing. They've have had a solid core range of cask ales that a few years ago, seemed like a breath of fresh air, but seem safe and staid compared to the current crop of craft beers. They have been doing a decent job of catching up with craft upstarts though, opening their first bar in Birmingham city centre with a good range of craft beers, and putting out their first keg (and canned, natch) IPA.

Like Purity, Staffordshire lager brewery Freedom have been knocking around for a while, introducing quality lagers to local M&B pubs, and are a common sight around the country. They've also been doing a good few of specials recently, including a barrel-aged lager, a kölsch, and a (just launched) IPL.

These are a small selection of breweries that popped into my head (I've DEFINITELY missed some - let me know if there's any glaring omissions in the comments), and we have more than our fair share of awesome traditional real ale breweries (Bathams Best has accquired legendary status round these parts - boring brown maybe, but one of the most fantastically made best bitters I've ever drank), but it does seem that, for our size, we do seem to be lacking when it comes to the craft.

That said, the Birmingham beer scene continues to be as lively as ever, so I'm hoping that, as people get more exposed to more exciting beers in the region, we'll be seeing more and more breweries cropping up in years to come.
