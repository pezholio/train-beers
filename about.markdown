Hey, I'm [Stu](http://twitter.com/pezholio), and this is my blog.

## Why Train Beers?

I'm a busy father of two, and I don't get a lot of time to write. I do, however, travel quite a bit to London for work, and this gives me a couple of hours to myself a week. I'm a journalist by trade, now a software developer, so I don't get much chance to write. The idea behind this blog was to give me chance to flex my writing muscles and write a few beer reviews on the train. This has branched out into more general beer writing, and led me to where I am today.

## What do you use for your blog?

As I'm a software developer, I like to be clever, and this blog uses the amazing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and is hosted (for free) on [Github](github.com/pezholio/train-beers). The theme is adapted from a theme by [Iron Summit Media](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll), and all my writing is done in the amazing [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which I recommend to anyone who writes for the web.

## Can I use your blog post somewhere?

Absolutely! All my content (unless otherwise stated) is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). This means you can use it, as long as you release anything you base on it under the same licence. If those terms are too onerous, get in touch, and we might be able to come to some sort of arrangement.

## Can I send you some beer?

Yes! Please do. Although I can't promise I'll be nice about it (ethics, y'know?).

## How do I get in touch with you?

[Twitter](http://twitter.com/train_beers) is best, or you can [drop me an email](mailto:pezholio+trainbeers@gmail.com).

## Are you on Untappd?

[Yeah, I totally am!](http://untappd.com/pezholio). I'll add it to the site footer when I get round to making an icon that matches the rest.
